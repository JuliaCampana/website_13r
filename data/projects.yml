EMMA:
  name: 'Emma'
  title: 'In situ metallization of hydroelectric turbine blades'
  descrition: 'Hydroelectric turbines deal with complex water flows. Turbulence causes early erosion of the blades that, if left unchecked, leads to failures in the powerplant. This is a major financial risk, as the production lost while stopping a typical turbine can quickly end up to be more than a million of Brazilian reais (300k USD). Moreover, if the blade damage is too high, one would need to replace the blades which is a major undertaking. In order to avoid damage, the blades are hard-coated with an alloy that is resistant to the abrasion process. This is applied before the turbine is mounted in the powerplant. Unfortunately, in some powerplants such as the Jirau plan from ESBR, re-applying the coating would require to unmount the turbine which, there, is a very time-consuming task. Below, damage on a turbine blade after one year of operations. The difference in color on the right, between the matte aspect and more metallic aspect is the difference between the zones where coating is still present and the zones where abrasion was removed it.'

HEADS:
  name: 'HEADS'
  title: 'Hydrocarbon Early Automatic Detection System'
  descrition: 'The goal of this project is to improve the monitoring of offshore facilities when it comes to hydrocarbon leaks. The project itself deals with the improvement of the existing HEADS system, which has already been developed as a collaboration between INDRA and Repsol Spain. This is a collaboration led by Repsol Brazil between INDRA in Spain, 13 Robotics, the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) and Tecgraf in Brazil.'

ROSA:
  name: 'ROSA'
  title: 'Instrumentation of Stoplogs in Hydroelectric Powerplants'
  descrition: 'When inspection and maintenance is needed on hydroelectric powerplant turbines, operators need to close the water flow. This is done in different ways that depend on the type of plant. A common method is to use stoplogs. Stoplogs are massive metallic gates that are slid in a rail that is embedded at the mouth of the turbine tunnel. See the following video for a demonstration of the mechanism: Youtube Video courtesy of Heargate Technoservice. Heartgate Technoservice has no relationship with the ROSA project nor with 13 Robotics.'
